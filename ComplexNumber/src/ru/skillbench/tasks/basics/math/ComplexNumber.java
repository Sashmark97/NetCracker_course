/**
 * GOALS<ul>
 * <li>To learn OOP basics: basic principles of writing a class, getters/setters, <code>this</code> keyword.</li>
 * <li>To get familiar with some methods of {@link Object} and with {@link Comparable} interface.</li>
 * <li>To be able to use some java.lang and java.itil API: {@link String}, {@link Double}, {@link Arrays}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * TASK<br/>
 * Implement a class storing a single complex number with basic mathematical operations on it.<br/>
 * Instances of the class must be comparable, cloneable and representable as String (in the common format).
 * <p/>
 * REQUIREMENTS<ul>
 * <li>The complex number consists of two components: real part (re) and imaginary part (im).
 *   They should be stored as private fields (members of the class) of type double or Double.
 *   After instantiation of the number with default constructor both re and im must be equal to 0.</li>
 * <li>Every math operation on the number (add, negate, multiply methods) should change the state of this object 
 *   not creating a new object (this requirement is intended to save memory and to lower calculation time). 
 *   For a caller's convenience, all these methods (math operations) return this object itself.</li>
 * <li>The common requirement for any task (to check it online) is to declare your class as follows:<br/>
 * <code>public class ComplexNumberImpl implements ComplexNumber {  } </code></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * NOTES<ul>
 * <li>When coded with the methods of this interface, formulas like z = x-y^2 could look like this:<br/>
 *  <code>ComplexNumber z = x.add(y.copy().multiply(y).negate());</code><br/>
 *  where <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> are objects of type ComplexNumber.</li>
 * <li>The task can be solved without any knowledge of Exceptions, but if you know that topic 
 *  explicit generation of {@link NumberFormatException} in {@link #set(String)} method is recommended.</li>
 * <li>It's recommended (but not required) to have the following set of constructors:<br/>
 *   <code>public ComplexNumberImpl(double re, double im);</code><br/>
 *   <code>public ComplexNumberImpl(String value);</code><br/>
 *   <code>public ComplexNumberImpl();</code> (this no-argument constructor is required by the checking system).</li>
 * <li>If you don't understand the mathematical meaning of the complex number you can read e.g. 
 *  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">Complex Number at Wikipedia</a>.</li>
 * <li>A professional Java implementation of this concept can be found here:
 *  <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/complex.html">Complex in Apache Commons Math</a>.</li>
 *  </ul>
